From the Data Frame we are trying to prove 3 hypotheses

Hypotheses:
#1 Top 3 countries has more shark attacks than the rest of the world combined
#2 Males beeen 15-40 are the subgroup that gets the most attacks
#3 Most countries where surf is popular are the ones that get the most shark attacks

Turns out the first and second hypotheses are true but not the third one since most common cause of death in other countries other than the USA is swimming.
